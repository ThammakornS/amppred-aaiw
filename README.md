*Note:*  
Python 3.8 may need to be included in the environment, and the library h5py needs to be installed using 
the command 'pip install h5py'. In some cases, TensorFlow and Keras also need to be installed using pip. 
Consequently, the TensorFlow and Keras packages need to be installed again within the R environment.
